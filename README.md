fitnesse-cppslim [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AIM360/fitnesse-cppslim.png)](https://travis-ci.org/AIM360/fitnesse-cppslim)
==========

This is a C++ header only library for writting [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org) test fixtures in C++. The only external dependency is on the [Boost library](http://boost.org) for handling the socket based communication between the FitNesse server and the FitNesse test runner.

For example, for implementing the test fixture for [this](SampleFixtures/FitNesseRoot/SampleFixturesSuite/ShouldBuyMilkTest/content.txt) FitNesse [Decision table](http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.SliM.DecisionTable) in C++ you only need to do something like [this](SampleFixtures/ShouldBuyMilk.cpp).

You can browse some more very simple sample fixtures in the [SampleFixtures](SampleFixtures) folder.
